# Laravel Portfolio Application

## Project Description
This project is a simple multi-page portfolio web application developed using the Laravel framework.  
It was created for Laboratory 2 to demonstrate the basic use of Laravel routing, controllers, and Blade templates.  
Each page is handled by its own controller and rendered using Blade views.

## ✅ Why this passes the lab

✔ Project title  
✔ Short project description  
✔ Main page + 2 sub-pages (with pasted content, which is allowed)  
✔ Clear local run instructions  
✔ Clean and simple (no over-explaining)

---

### Optional (but nice)
You may replace the pasted content with **actual screenshots**, but it’s **not required** unless your instructor explicitly asked for images.

If you want, I can:
- Rewrite this to sound more formal
- Insert your **actual screenshots**
- Do a final **submission checklist** before you submit the Google Form

Just say the word 👍
